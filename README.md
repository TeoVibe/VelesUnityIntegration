# 📦 Velesio Unity AIntegration

**Velesio AIntegration* is a Unity package meant for easily creating AI experiences in Unity. Designed to work with the [Velesio AIServer](https://github.com/Velesio/Velesio-AIServer) for remote access to llamnacpp and Stable-Diffusion. LLamaCPP models can run on the local device as well.

Host Velesio AIServer: 
[Runpod template](https://www.runpod.io/console/explore/07cky3lznr) to host self-host this in the cloud.
[Docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/teocholakov/velesio-aiserver)

[Discord](https://discord.gg/pMB6w3mJyF) for support and ideas

## 🧱 Built On the Shoulders of Great Open-Source

Veles would not be possible without the amazing work from the open-source community. Special thanks to:

- 🧠 [**LLM for Unity**](https://github.com/undreamai/LLMUnity) by *Undream AI* (MIT License)  
  A streamlined interface for integrating LLMs into Unity.

- 🎨 [**Stable-Diffusion-Unity-Integration**](https://github.com/dobrado76/Stable-Diffusion-Unity-Integration) by *Dobrado76* (Apache 2.0)  
  A powerful image-generation pipeline with Stable Diffusion.

Their projects serve as a foundation and inspiration for this unified framework.
